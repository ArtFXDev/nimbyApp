## Nimby field

The "NIMBY" field is set on a Tractor blade.

It has 3 states:
```
1 - will only accept local jobs spooled from that blade's host (local jobs).
0 - will accept jobs from anyone (external jobs).
username - will only accept jobs from the named user.
```

## Nimby App

The user chooses between 2 states:
- **Manual** - Nimby ON : the Nimby field is set to 1, blocking external jobs.  
- **Auto** : - Nimby OFF : The Nimby field is set to 0, allowing external jobs.  

When the mode is "Auto", the app checks automatically if a significant software is started (as defined in `config.json`).
If such a software is launched, the Nimby field is set to 1 (blocking).


## Dev Doc

It's use electron (tray icon) and react (main page).

It uses the Tractor URL Api (and currently the Tactor Controller). See [tractor](https://github.com/ArtFXDev/tractor).

This app has dev, build and deploy scripts.
